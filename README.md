# Overview


This Program keeps a database of a person's 3 favorite movies. You can delete people, edit their movies, and add new people as well.


I wrote this software because I think it super interesting to know what everybody's favorite movies are! It also helped me get more comfortable with SQL

# Relational Database

I used SQL Lite and python.

The Structure is pretty simple. It is a table with a column for name and then favorite movie one, two, and three.

# Development Environment


I used VS code, python, and SQL Lite.

I used python and sqlite 3.

# Future Work
* I would like to add a function that could switch the order of the movies entered.
* I would like to use an api to get the movies critics ratings. I tried to do this but rotten tomatoes api costs quite a bit.
* I would like to add some analysis on the list of movies to see which ones were used multiple times.
